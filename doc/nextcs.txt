INTRO                                                            *nextCSIntro*

nextCS (next Color Scheme) changes your theme in one shot. It's based on some
other scripts I found who didn't work with some silly color schemes. This one
will load every theme you got. If it's incorrect, you'll see the error, but
you'll able to just press "next" (F12) and you'll see the next.

Simple enough!

USAGE                                                           *nextCSUsage*

    F12 Next
    F11 Previous

CONFIGURATION                                                   *nextCSConfig*

These options should be set in your .vimrc file.

g:nextcs_dir                                         *nextCSConfig-nextcs-dir*
    Use this option to configure the theme folder from where nextCS should
    fetch Color Schemes (it will look at every directory present in the
    $runtimepath/ var). >
        let g:nextcs_dir = 'colors/'
<

g:nextcs_map                                         *nextCSConfig-nextcs-map*
    Use this option to configure the mapping you want to use to preview the
    next Color Scheme. >
        let g:nextcs_map = '<F12>'
<

g:previouscs_map                                 *nextCSConfig-previouscs-map*
    Use this option to configure the mapping you want to use to preview the
    previous Color Scheme. >
        let g:nextcs_map = '<F11>'
<

    NOTE: The mappings are enabled in normal mode.

nextCS has worked for me for a few years now as it is. if you need something
else the best way to get it is to send a patch. Fork and send your pull
request =)
