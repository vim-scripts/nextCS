nextCS (next Color Scheme) changes your theme in one shot. It's based on some other scripts I found who didn't work with some silly color schemes. This one will load *every* theme you got. If it's incorrect, you'll see the error, but you'll able to just press "next" (F12) and you'll see the next.

<F12> Next
<F11> Previous

Simple enough :)
